# Yi Luo — Portfolio & Research Site

**Live site:** https://ymo26.github.io/

I build data-driven stories at the intersection of **Mathematics, Economics, and Electrical/Computer Engineering**.  
On this site I publish research notes, class projects, and reproducible outputs that move from **clean data → careful methods → clear visuals**.

### What I do
- **Forecasting & ML:** LSTM and traditional models for economic time series; feature engineering and evaluation workflows.
- **GIS & Environment:** Urban Heat Island analysis with Python + open data; map-first storytelling.
- **Causal/Econometrics:** Regression diagnostics, model selection, and policy-focused inference.
- **Decision & Optimization:** AHP survey design and ranking; scenario analysis and trade-off visualization.
- **Systems & Sensors:** Raspberry Pi Pico projects (IMU, I2C), control logic, and data logging.

### Highlights on the site
- **Election Campaign Projections (Python):** data cleaning, swing-state mapping, and interpretable visuals.  
- **Urban Heat Island (GIS/Python):** pipeline from open sources to maps and summary stats.  
- **Economic Forecasting with a Tunable LSTM:** bridging classical baselines and deep learning.  
- **LaFarm Motivation Study (AHP):** survey design → pairwise comparisons → priority weights → dashboards.

### Built with
HTML/CSS/JS, Python (pandas, matplotlib), R, LaTeX, and GitHub Pages for deployment.

> **Goal:** make methods transparent and results reproducible—so others can learn, reuse, or extend.
